# Chicago Mayor 2019

An analysis of 13 candidates for the Chicago Mayor's office in the election of 2019.

1.  Take the results of [this questionnaire](https://interactive.wbez.org/2019/mayoral-questionnaire/).
2.  Assign a score for each response to each question.
3.  Tally the scores and sort the candidates by the tallies.

The source data and scores that I assigned for each question are in the resources directory.  If you feel you want to rescore or make whatever changes you deem fit, you may fork this repository.  The code is [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).
